# ReactBoard
Chess Board UI built with react.

Currently a work in progress, but as an end goal, I'm hoping to rival the functionality of Chessboard.js (http://www.chessboardjs.com/)

Set up:
   npm install

Running:
   npm start


codesandbox.io is a nice, in browser place, to edit this code because it's built to work with react.
